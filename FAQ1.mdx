  <Accordion icon="circle-question" title="Q: HOW CAN I SHARE RESOURCES WITH MY ONLINE LEARNER?">
    Remember that tutors cannot directly email their learners. Both Tutor Cruncher (administration platform) and Lesson Space (online session platform) allow exchanging files between a learner and a tutor in a more public space. Check the provided tutorials.

  <Accordion icon="circle-question" title="Q I HAVE AN EMERGENCY AND CANNOT CONDUCT THE PLANNED SESSION">
    If a tutor is unwell or unable to meet the learner as agreed, the following steps must be taken. 

    For online sessions: 
    Go on Tutor Cruncher and mark the session "Cancelled" ASAP, adding a note about the reason for the cancellation. Once you cancel your session on TC, your learner gets an automated notification and will not be waiting for you online. 
    Email your Contract Manager and let them know. 

    For face-to-face sessions: 
    Please ensure that you know the school office phone number (if the tuition is at school) or the parent's mobile (in case of alternative provision) just for this purpose. If you are unable to attend, it is your responsibility to inform them to avoid any disruption/miscommunication. If you cannot contact, you must inform our office ASAP on 01992 637 336.  You will need to provide the following information: your name, the school or the learner you work with, planned session time. 
    Go on Tutor Cruncher and mark the session "Cancelled" , adding a note about the reason for the cancellation. Email your Contract Manager and let them know.
