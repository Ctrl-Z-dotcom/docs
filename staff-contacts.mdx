#### Communication is essential in this role, as we are dealing with a number of stakeholders. This will be more than you might be used to as a class teacher or a private tutor. Where there are multiple stakeholders, it is easy for communication channels to become blurred or misinterpreted. As such, communication must be clear, timely and effective.
