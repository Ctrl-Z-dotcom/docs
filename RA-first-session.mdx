    <p>All alternative provision placements must be underpinned by appropriate risk assessments. Risk assessment is an integral part of any tutor role, requiring partnership working with parents/carers and schools to discuss and evaluate potential risks together.</p>
    <p>This collaborative approach enables tutors to understand learner needs, including any child protection concerns and agency involvement, within the context of the placement.</p>

Early help and collaborative working
<Info>
  **Early Help Assessments (EHAs)** are initiated by trained DSLs where concerns don't meet statutory intervention thresholds. EM Tuition works collaboratively with other professionals to develop shared support plans, ensuring comprehensive wraparound support for vulnerable learners.
</Info>
<Warning>
  **Critical requirement:** All risk assessments must be completed before the first teaching session begins. Where other agencies are involved, they should be invited to contribute to ensure a coordinated approach to safeguarding.
</Warning>
